// The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.

let count = 5;

do {
    console.log("Count is: " + count); // This prints once.
    count++;
} while (count < 5); // The condition is false, so the loop exits immediately after printing the message one time.
